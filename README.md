# Prog2-Minesweeper
Fully functional Minesweeper game for programming 2 class project. My implementation uses polymorphism and file I/O to develop board and tile classes to store game parameters. Specifically, the tile class includes mine status, flag status, and adjacent mines. Additionally, the tile class stores the number of mines, game status, and a list of tiles. In main(), external library SFML's sf::Sprite and sf::Texture features are utilized to display graphics in conformity with board characteristics. Additionally, event-driven programming is utilized to update graphics and object parameters in conformity with user input.
